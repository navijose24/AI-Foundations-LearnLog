### 🌱 **What is Logic?**

Logic is a formal language for **representing knowledge** and **reasoning** about it.
It uses *facts* and *rules* to draw new conclusions (inference).

Example:

* Fact: “It is raining.”
* Rule: “If it is raining, the road will be wet.”
* Inference: “The road will be wet.”

This process of reasoning is what logical agents do.

#### 🧩 **Types of Logic**

1. **Propositional Logic (PL)** — simplest form, deals with true/false statements.
2. **First Order Predicate Logic (FOPL)** — more powerful, deals with *objects*, *relations*, and *quantifiers* (like “for all” and “there exists”).

#### 🔢 **Propositional Logic – Key Concepts**

| Term            | Meaning                                          | Example                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Proposition** | A statement that is either True (T) or False (F) | “It is raining”                                  |
| **Connectives** | Combine propositions                             | AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), IF...THEN (→), IFF (↔) |
| **Sentence**    | A logical formula built from propositions        | (Rain → WetRoad)                                 |
| **Model**       | An assignment of truth values to propositions    | Rain = T, WetRoad = T                            |

#### 🧠 **Why Logic in AI?**

Because AI needs to:

* Represent real-world facts precisely.
* Derive new knowledge automatically using inference.
* Decide actions based on consistent reasoning.
