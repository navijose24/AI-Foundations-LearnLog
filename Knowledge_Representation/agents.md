###  **Logical Agents — Knowledge-Based Agents**

#### 🧠 What it means:

A **logical agent** is an AI that reasons and makes decisions **using knowledge and logic** rather than just pre-coded instructions.

#### 🧩 The Core Idea:

Unlike normal reflex agents (which react directly to inputs), a *knowledge-based agent* stores what it knows about the world and uses **inference** to figure out what to do next.

---

#### 💡 Structure of a Knowledge-Based Agent:

1. **Knowledge Base (KB)** – stores facts and rules (like “If it’s raining → carry an umbrella”)
2. **Inference Engine** – applies logical reasoning to the KB (derives new facts)
3. **Percept & Action Loop** – observes the world, updates KB, and decides actions.

---

#### ⚙️ Example:

Imagine a vacuum-cleaner robot:

* Perceives: “The current room is dirty.”
* KB says: “If a room is dirty → clean it.”
* The inference engine reasons: “Room1 is dirty → I should clean Room1.”
* Action: The robot cleans it ✅

#### 📘 Where it’s used:

* Expert systems (like medical diagnosis)
* Virtual assistants (reasoning over knowledge graphs)
* Game AIs and chatbots (for logical dialogue)
* Robotic planning and decision-making.
