What is Artificial Intelligence(AI) ? 
    Machines mimic human intelligence - learning,reasoning,prblm-solving and decision making.

    father of ai:John McCathy

    how it works:
    data->algorithms->computational power

    key areas:
    ML:make predition based on the data and patterns
    DL:mimic human brain's neural system
    NLP:computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language
    Computer Vision:computers to "see" and interpret visual information

    types:
    artificial narrow intelligence - identify and perform specific tasks
    artificial general intelligence - learn,adopt and improve from the previous actions
    artificial super intelligence - self aware entity


The Foundations of AI
    Mathematics → logic, probability, optimization.
    Philosophy → reasoning, mind-body questions.
    Psychology → how humans think/learn.
    Neuroscience → how the brain works.
    Computer Science → algorithms, programming.
    Control Theory & Cybernetics → feedback systems, robotics.
    Linguistics → natural language understanding.


History of AI
    foundation : pre-1970
        1943->Warren McCulloch-> artifical neuron
        1950->Alan Turning->Turning test
        1956->John McCathy->Artificial intelligence term
        1950-1960 ->chatterbot ELIZA
    AI winter & resurgence : 1970-1990
        1974->lighthill report->fund cuts->ai winter
        1980->expert system->which uses human intelligence to make decisions-> commercial boom-> ai summer
        early 1990-> decline of expert systems-> 2nd ai winter
        1997->Deep Blue(IBM's super computer)->beats world chees player
    ML & DL : 2000-2010
        2000->increase in computing power ->large datasets ->ml growth
        2011->Watson(IBM)->worn the quiz show Jeopardy
              APPLE realized Siri
        2012->AlexNet->image recoginision model
        2016->AlphaGo(Google DeepMind)
    Generative ai : 2020-present
        2020->Openai->GPT 3
        2021->DALL-E -> image generation model
        2022->other LLM's 
        2024->Sora,Veo ->video gen models
        2025->Agentic AI


Applications of AI
    Healthcare (diagnosis, drug discovery)
    Finance (fraud detection, trading)
    Transportation (autonomous cars)
    Education (personalized learning, tutoring systems)
    Agriculture (smart irrigation, yield prediction)
    Entertainment (Netflix/Spotify recommendations, gaming)


Intelligent Agents 
    An agent = system that perceives (via sensors) and acts (via actuators).
    🌀 Example:
    Self-driving car → sensors (cameras, lidar) → agent → actuators (steering, brakes).
